# Advanced Techniques for Container Migration in Moving Target Defense

This project explores advanced techniques for container migration as part of a Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy, utilizing the Kubelet Checkpoint API, which is still in its beta phase as of Kubernetes v1.30. The goal of this project is to perform live migration of containers while preserving their state, allowing stateful container migration that ensures seamless transitions between environments without losing the container's current state or data.

This project was originally created in the context of a bachelor thesis with the same title by:
- **Rinchen Kolodziejczyk**
- **Anthony John Mamaril**

Full credits to both authors for their significant contributions.

In the context of a master's degree semester project, the work has been extended to integrate a simulated attack scenario. The purpose of this scenario is to provide a real-world use case demonstrating the effectiveness of container migration techniques.
